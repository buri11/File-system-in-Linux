# File-system-in-Linux
This project is about navigating in the Linux file system and reading files via raw bytes and interpreting them accordingly.

This was a project at the Operating Systems subject at my university. The requirements for this project are listed in the a1.pdf file along with a comprehensive description of the format of the files that are to be read and the commands for running the project.

All of this is created to be run on a Linux machine and my solution is in the a1.c file, everything else being created by my teacher.

The test_root folder contains all the folders and files that I am using for my project. I open, navigate through, read and interpret them.
